# Machine Learning Zoomcamp Course

I'll be adding coursework and other relevant things to this github repo.

The course can be found at https://datatalks.club/courses/2021-winter-ml-zoomcamp.html

# Week 4 Changes
The dataset listed for the homework for the course did not have appropriately labeled target values or if it did, it was a multiclass classification problem not binomial.
As such, I chose to use a different dataset but still focused on ROC AUC for logistic regression and random forest classifiers as well as precision recall curves.

# Skipping Week 5-6 Homework
Because of the nature of what I had to do for the Week 4 homework, I'll be building on the work I did for Week 4 and use that for the midterm assignment
